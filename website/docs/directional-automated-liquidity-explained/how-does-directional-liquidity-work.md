# 🔍 How Does Directional Liquidity Work?

**Explore the mechanics behind Canopy's Directional Liquidity capabilities and how it revolutionizes liquidity provision.**

## 🌐 **Understanding Traditional AMMs**

Traditional Automated Market Makers (AMMs):

- **Require Asset Pairs**: Users provide liquidity in pairs (e.g., ETH/USDC).
- **Impermanent Loss Risk**: Subject to value loss when asset prices fluctuate.
- **Capital Inefficiency**: Users must hold equal value of two assets.

---

## 🔄 **Introducing Directional Liquidity**

Directional Liquidity powered by ICHI ALM:

- **Single-Asset Liquidity**: Provide liquidity using only one asset.
- **Reduced Risk**: Minimize exposure to impermanent loss.
- **Inventory Awareness**: Adjust strategies based on asset availability.

---

## 🛠️ **How Directional Liquidity Operates**

### **1. Single-Asset Deposits**

- **Ease of Use**: Deposit your preferred asset without needing a pair.
- **Flexibility**: Choose any supported asset for liquidity provision.

### **2. ICHI ALM Integration**

- **Dynamic Adjustments**: The ICHI ALM monitors asset inventory levels.
- **Optimal Pricing**: Adjusts prices to maintain balance and prevent depletion.

### **3. Automated Liquidity Management**
