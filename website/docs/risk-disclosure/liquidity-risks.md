# ‚ö†Ô∏è Liquidity Risks

**Understand the potential challenges related to liquidity when participating in the Canopy ecosystem.**

---

## üíß **What is Liquidity Risk?**

- **Market Depth**: The ability to buy or sell assets without causing significant price movement.
- **Liquidity Crunch**: Occurs when there is insufficient liquidity, leading to slippage or inability to execute trades.
- **Withdrawal Delays**: High network congestion or protocol limitations may delay withdrawals.

---

## ‚ö° **Potential Liquidity Issues**

- **Slippage**: Large orders may experience slippage due to limited liquidity in pools.
- **Price Impact**: Significant trades can affect token prices, potentially leading to losses.
- **Pool Imbalances**: Disproportionate token ratios in liquidity pools may affect trading efficiency.
