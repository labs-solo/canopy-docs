# 🔄 Directional Liquidity

**Unlock the power of single-token liquidity provision with Canopy's innovative Directional Liquidity technology.**

## 🚀 **What is Directional Liquidity?**

Directional Liquidity is a groundbreaking approach that allows you to provide liquidity using a **single type of asset**, eliminating the need to pair it with another token. This is made possible through our integration with **ICHI Automated Liquidity Manager (ALM)** technology.

## 🌐 **Why It Matters**

- **Mitigated Risk**: Reduce exposure to impermanent loss and avoid over-selling your valuable assets.
- **Simplified Process**: Deposit a single asset without the complexity of traditional liquidity provision.
- **Asset Accumulation**: Focus on growing your preferred asset while earning trading fees.

---

## 🛠️ **How It Works**

1. **Single-Token Deposits**: Choose your preferred asset and deposit it into a **Single-Token Liquidity Pool**.
2. **Liquidity Provision**: Your asset contributes to the liquidity pool, facilitating trades and earning you fees.
3. **Inventory-Aware Strategy**: The ICHI ALM dynamically manages the pool to maintain optimal asset balance.
