# üó≥Ô∏è Governance

**Shape the future of Canopy by participating in our inclusive and transparent governance process.**

## üåê **Community-Driven Decisions**

- **Dual Token Voting**: Both $LEAF and $OAK token holders have voting rights, ensuring a balanced representation.
- **Proposal Submission**: Any token holder can submit proposals for improvements or changes to the ecosystem.
- **Transparent Processes**: All governance activities are conducted openly, with records available on the blockchain.

## üóùÔ∏è **Voting Mechanics**

- **One Token, One Vote**: Each $LEAF token equals one vote in governance proposals.
- **Immediate Influence**: Participate in decisions affecting the short-term direction of Canopy.

### **$OAK Holders**

- **Future Value Weighting**: Voting power is based on the future value of $LEAF tokens at $OAK maturity.
